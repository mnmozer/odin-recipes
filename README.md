HTML and CSS knowledge practice following the The Odin Project course. 
Created some recipes pages as a project using basic HTML tags like headers, paragraphs, list, line breaks, images, links and etc.

Added basic CSS to give style to the index and recipes pages. Doing this I've practiced some CSS foundations and learned new properties.
