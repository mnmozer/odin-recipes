 <h2>Description</h2>

    It's an easy and delicious meal that the whole family will appreciate. 
    This is the only grilled salmon recipe you need.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 salmon filets</li>
    <li>1/2 cup ponzu or soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>3 tbsp. honey or brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tsp. grated ginger</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. rice wine vinegar/li>
    <li>Sesame seeds and sliced green onion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the grilled salmon marinade by whisking together the soy sauce, water, honey, 
        ginger, and rice wine vinegar.<br>
        Pour over the salmon filets in a resealable bag and marinate for 30 minutes to one hour at 
        room temperature.</li>
    <li>Pull the fish out of the marinade and pat very dry. 
        Coat the entire fish with a small amount of oil before grilling.</li>
    <li>Pour the reserved marinade in a small pot and boil for 3-5 minutes, 
        or until it coats the back of a spoon to make a glaze.</li>
    <li>While the fish is marinating, get charcoal very hot or set the grill to high heat.<br>
        When you're ready to cook, lay the salmon skin-side down and brush with the glaze. 
        Cover the grill with a lid and cook for 4-6 minutes, or until the skin is crispy and the 
        fish is three fourths of the way cooked through.<br>
        Brush with the glaze again, then flip. Cook for another minute to let the topside char, 
        then carefully remove from the grill. The fish should flake easily with a fork.</li>
</ol>
